# Python basics course - The kick-start for learning on your own

Signup via google form [here](https://goo.gl/forms/C6sXQljaYCFDLZoC2).


## What to expect:
* some short presentation about how stuff works and then learning by doing
* something as [pyladies](http://pyladies.cz/brno/) to some extent, I can't guarantee we will have time for all "basics"
    *  basics should cover:
        * Variables, Data Types and Basic operations
        * Conditionals and Boolean Expressions
        * Loops and iterations
        * Development workflow and testing the code
        * File operations, JSONs, String parsing, maybe HTML parsing
        * Functions, Built in Libraries and [Python Package Index (PyPI)](https://pypi.org/)
        * Try & Except, Error Types
        * ...probably missed something important
* With the knowledge you get on the course the reading of the book [Dive into Python 3](http://www.diveintopython3.net/) ([CZ verze](http://diveintopython3.py.cz/index.html)) should be easier
* set you on the path to realize some idea you think could be useful, so you can learn more about the required problematic and cooperate with people who try to do something similar


## Covered topics:

* python3 mainly with explanation about python2 differences and why it will end
* Interpreter/compiling - differences, what happens behind the hood
* Ipython/Bpython vim-jedi, ideal IDE and workflow for writing/testing
* pip, virtualenv vs stuff that is no longer used (so if you google for stuff, you won't get confused easilly)
* what can you do with python, from automating system stuff to multimedia and games in order to help you choose whatever you want to dig in more
* homework so you work on your weaker skills in your free time
* [Bash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_(Unix_shell))/[zsh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z_shell) both on unix and Windows and helpful tools (cat, grep, tmux, watch, ssh...)
* lastly how to make nice CV using LaTex - https://www.overleaf.com/gallery/tagged/cv or using some github rst>pdf whatever template so they are presentable

## Requirements:
* free time
* patience
* Ideally Arch Linux installed otherwise any RPM based or Deb based Linux distribution (Fedora Red Hat) or any deb based (Debian, Linux Mint, Ubuntu) or Windows 7+ PC OR any 2006+ laptop wit
h functional USB port to boot flash with Arch Linux from, so even notebooks without HDDs will work. You can try with some Apple product (MAC) but don't expect much support, since I have no e
xperience with those products.

## Resources:
* Books
    *  Already mentioned [Dive into Python 3](http://www.diveintopython3.net/) ([CZ verze](http://diveintopython3.py.cz/index.html))
    *  [Tons of others](https://pythonbooks.revolunet.com/)
    *  Recommendations will follow
* Videos
    * [Corey's Shaffer](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL-osiE80TeTt2d9bfVyTiXJA-UTHn6WwU) video tutorials
